I am an EPSRC funded PhD candidate in Deep Learning for classifying and segmenting aerial/satellite imagery at the University of Sussex, who is passionate about Artificial Intelligence, in particular Deep Learning and Computer Vision. 

Being part of the Predictive Analytical Lab (PAL) â€“ an interdisciplinary research team, I have been involved in a British Academy funded project focused on Satellite/Aerial Image Scene Segmentation, where I designed a classifier that classifies land scenes from satellite/aerial images. For more details please see: - https://wearepal.ai/projects/ssrp. 

The aim of the project is to apply deep learning techniques, to map peri-urban agriculture in Ghaziabad India, and research ways of integrating multiple types of data through a web-based mapping and visualisation tool.  

Currently I am investigating robustness of Deep Learning models to domain shifts such as year/season data sources. 

Prior to this, I worked as a Control and Automation Design Engineer for the oil and gas industry, where I was exposed to the full software and hardware life cycle, systems sensing and control, communications, project planning and management.

In addition, I designed and produced an automated greenhouse. The project was used as a platform that enabled me to conduct extensive research, whilst getting practical exposure to various aspects of the embedded software and hardware life cycle.
